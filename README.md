# WHFC
Implementation of the Weighted HyperFlowCutter hypergraph partitioning algorithm.
It works as a stand-alone 2-way partitioner but it works best as a refinement algorithm on a given partition.
This is a header-only library, so there is no setup overhead.
For an example, check out the integration in [KaHyPar](https://github.com/kahypar/kahypar/tree/master/kahypar/partition/refinement/flow).
